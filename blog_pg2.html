                    <p class="blog_body">In 1964, at the height of the space race between the U.S. and the former Soviet
                              Union, an unlikely competitor was plotting to enter the competition. Edwuard
                              Mukuka Nkoloso, a Zambian science teacher, started the unofficial Zambia
                              National Academy of Science, Space Research, and Philosophy, tapping students
                              from local schools and youth groups to join the lunar training program. Nkoloso
                              dubbed them “Afronauts”, and had the trainees perform exercises that included
                              rolling down hills in an oil drum and launching themselves from tree swings to
                              simulate weightlessness. Their space suits reportedly consisted of green satin
                              jackets and capes made from ornate African fabrics. Western reporters caught
                              wind of the story, but most reported on it incredulously, characterizing Nkoloso
                              as a “crackpot” and the program as a laughable lost cause (Serpell, 2017). The
                              Afronauts never made it to the moon. Nkoloso was unable to secure funding and
                              Matha Mwamba, the 16 year old girl they intended to launch along with her six
                              cats, got pregnant by another student and returned home. The program was
                              disbanded, and the story forgotten.

                              Half a century later, Spanish photographer Cristina de Middel unearthed old
                              footage of the Zambian space program. Looking through the past coverage, she
                              bristled against the stereotypical representations of African people as uncivilized
                              and the victims of tragic circumstance, particularly after discovering program
                              documents and images that held clues to the contrary (Schuman, 2013).
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_body">
                              She subsequently put out The Afronauts, a
                              2013 photobook which reimagines the
                              story anew. De Middel’s portrayal
                              offers a more suggestive and contextual
                              retelling of this unconventional
                              story, elevating the afronaut’s pursuit
                              by likening it to the dreams of other
                              nations that led to progress rather than
                              reducing it to a fool’s errand. In doing
                              so, she highlights the inherent subjectivity
                              of the previous photographic
                              coverage, critiquing the notion that
                              photography is a medium of objective
                              truth. By including meticulously recreated
                              letters and documents she underscored
                              the power of design in providing
                              adequate contextual information to
                              create more nuanced and representative
                              narratives.

                              The long held notion that a photograph
                              serves as an artifact of truth ignores all
                              of the circumstances and decisions that
                              precede and follow the taking of a
                              picture, the contextual information
                              essential for understanding. Consider
                              the famous photograph by Eddie
                              Adams of Nguyen Van Lem, a Viet
                              Cong soldier, being shot in the head by
                              Nguyen Ngoc Loan, a South Vietnamese
                              general. The photo went on to be
                              printed and broadcast by news organizations
                              around the world as an artifact
                              of the brutality of the Vietnamese.
                              But as Adams himself notes, "photography
                              by its nature is selective. It
                              isolates a single moment, divorcing
                              that moment from the moments before
                              and after that possibly lead to adjusted
                              meaning" (Eddie Adams' iconic photo,
                              2018). Adams notes that initially, he
                              too interpreted the general actions as
                              cold and calculating. But later, he
                              learned that Lem had killed the family
                              of one of Loan’s fellow soldiers. South
                              Vietnam had just been ambushed by
                              the Viet Cong’s Tet Offensive and "if
                              you hesitate, if you don't do your duty,
                              the men won't follow you," the general
                              later explained to Adams (Eddie
                              Adams' iconic photo, 2018). It would
                              be impossible for a single image to
                              capture the entirety of these circumstances.
                              And upon learning them, the
                              truth becomes much more complicated
                              and open to interpretation.
