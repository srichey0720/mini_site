                    <p class="blog_body">According to a 2018 Kaiser
                              Family Foundation report, a
                              record number of Americans
                              have reported feeling frequently
                              alone, with the Covid-19 pandemic
                              deepening these trends. This has led
                              several top government and public
                              health officials to declare a secondary
                              pandemic of loneliness; the U.S.
                              Surgeon General Dr. Murthy went so
                              far as to write a book about it. There
                              are a multitude of suspected causal
                              factors, from the rise of social media
                              to suburban sprawl. As design serves
                              as a mediating force between us and
                              so much of the world, it is important to
                              consider its implication in the current
                              rise of self-reported loneliness and
                              social isolation. Much of contemporary
                              design, particularly in our cities and
                              communities, is focused more on individuation
                              as it relates to economic
                              gain than on designing for a strong
                              social fabric. But with the intention of
                              creating spaces that foster meaningful
                              social interactions, a user-centered
                              approach to the design of the built
                              world can help to confront this crisis.

                              What is Loneliness?
                              It seems like a somewhat diffuse and
                              hard to quantify concept. According to
                              the Center for Disease Control, loneliness
                              is the feeling of being alone,
                              regardless of the amount of social
                              contact one has. Social isolation, on
                              the other hand, is a lack of social
                              connection. They are distinct, but intertwined,
                              with social isolation often
                              leading to feelings of loneliness.

                    <p class="blog_body">
                              The Kaiser Family Foundation first set
                              out to measure loneliness in 2018
                              using a series of questions based on
                              the UCLA and Giervald scale that ask
                              the participants about their social
                              connectedness and the perception of
                              their quality of life in relation. It is selfreported,
                              which is important because
                              it is an inherently subjective experience.
                              One in five, or 22% of Americans
                              reported feeling lonely. While it is
                              often thought of as a problem that
                              disproportionately affects the elderly,
                              all age ranges were represented with
                              a higher share of 18-50 year old individuals
                              feeling more lonely than any
                              other age range (DiJulio et al., 2018).
                              More women reported these feelings
                              than men. And certain circumstantial
                              factors seem to predispose someone
                              to experiencing loneliness, with social
                              isolation or death of loved one as the
                              leading cause, followed closely by
                              having a mental or physical disability,chronic illness, and being socioeconomically
                              disadvantaged. While the
                              report touched on the cultural and
                              personal distinctions in the perception
                              of loneliness, the political divide
                              among those who reported loneliness
                              wasn’t significant, so it appears to
                              touch diverse swaths of the country.

                              This isn’t a fleeting phenomenon either.
                              Half of those affected described
                              feeling this way for several years, which
                              over time can take a serious toll on
                              one’s quality of life, sense of self-worth,
                              and health. One woman who was
                              surveyed described feeling so invisible
                              to those in her life that she moved to a
                              new city because she felt it was less
                              painful to be lonely because she didn’t
                              know anyone than to feel neglected by
                              those who she assumed cared for her
                              (DiJulio et al., 2018). It is a self perpetuating
                              problem that leads to expectation
                              of rejection and criticism of the
                              individual themself and others, reinforcing
                              social isolation. Those who
                              experience loneliness suffer from
                              higher rates of depression, anxiety and
                              substance abuse. A study by Heart
                              Journal notes that prolonged periods
                              of social isolation have the equivalent
                              adverse effect of smoking 15 cigarettes a day (Valtorta et al., 2016). All of this
                              is to say that loneliness is dangerous to
                              both the individual experiencing it and
                              society as a whole.
