                    <p class="blog_body">According to a 2018 Kaiser
                              Family Foundation report, a
                              record number of Americans
                              have reported feeling frequently
                              alone, with the Covid-19 pandemic
                              deepening these trends. This has led
                              several top government and public
                              health officials to declare a secondary
                              pandemic of loneliness; the U.S.
                              Surgeon General Dr. Murthy went so
                              far as to write a book about it. There
                              are a multitude of suspected causal
                              factors, from the rise of social media
                              to suburban sprawl. As design serves
                              as a mediating force between us and
                              so much of the world, it is important to
                              consider its implication in the current
                              rise of self-reported loneliness and
                              social isolation. Much of contemporary
                              design, particularly in our cities and
                              communities, is focused more on individuation
                              as it relates to economic
                              gain than on designing for a strong
                              social fabric. But with the intention of
                              creating spaces that foster meaningful
                              social interactions, a user-centered
                              approach to the design of the built
                              world can help to confront this crisis.

                              What is Loneliness?
                              It seems like a somewhat diffuse and
                              hard to quantify concept. According to
                              the Center for Disease Control, loneliness
                              is the feeling of being alone,
                              regardless of the amount of social
                              contact one has. Social isolation, on
                              the other hand, is a lack of social
                              connection. They are distinct, but intertwined,
                              with social isolation often
                              leading to feelings of loneliness.

                    <p class="blog_body">
                              The Kaiser Family Foundation first set
                              out to measure loneliness in 2018
                              using a series of questions based on
                              the UCLA and Giervald scale that ask
                              the participants about their social
                              connectedness and the perception of
                              their quality of life in relation. It is selfreported,
                              which is important because
                              it is an inherently subjective experience.
                              One in five, or 22% of Americans
                              reported feeling lonely. While it is
                              often thought of as a problem that
                              disproportionately affects the elderly,
                              all age ranges were represented with
                              a higher share of 18-50 year old individuals
                              feeling more lonely than any
                              other age range (DiJulio et al., 2018).
                              More women reported these feelings
                              than men. And certain circumstantial
                              factors seem to predispose someone
                              to experiencing loneliness, with social
                              isolation or death of loved one as the
                              leading cause, followed closely by
                              having a mental or physical disability,chronic illness, and being socioeconomically
                              disadvantaged. While the
                              report touched on the cultural and
                              personal distinctions in the perception
                              of loneliness, the political divide
                              among those who reported loneliness
                              wasn’t significant, so it appears to
                              touch diverse swaths of the country.

                              This isn’t a fleeting phenomenon either.
                              Half of those affected described
                              feeling this way for several years, which
                              over time can take a serious toll on
                              one’s quality of life, sense of self-worth,
                              and health. One woman who was
                              surveyed described feeling so invisible
                              to those in her life that she moved to a
                              new city because she felt it was less
                              painful to be lonely because she didn’t
                              know anyone than to feel neglected by
                              those who she assumed cared for her
                              (DiJulio et al., 2018). It is a self perpetuating
                              problem that leads to expectation
                              of rejection and criticism of the
                              individual themself and others, reinforcing
                              social isolation. Those who
                              experience loneliness suffer from
                              higher rates of depression, anxiety and
                              substance abuse. A study by Heart
                              Journal notes that prolonged periods
                              of social isolation have the equivalent
                              adverse effect of smoking 15 cigarettes a day (Valtorta et al., 2016). All of this
                              is to say that loneliness is dangerous to
                              both the individual experiencing it and
                              society as a whole.

                              The Covid-19 Pandemic has exacerbated both the overall number of people experiencing
                              loneliness and the depth to which they feel it. A 2021 Harvard Graduate School of Education
                              study suggests that 36% of all Americans—including 61% of young adults and 51% of mothers
                              with young children—feel “serious loneliness” (Weissbourd et al., 2021). This is understandable
                              as social isolation became the new normal, the effects of which are still revealing themselves.
                              But the trend predates the pandemic, so it’s important to examine other potential underlying
                              causes. One thing that the pandemic laid bare was the inadequacies of using technology as a
                              replacement for social contact. The Kaiser Family Foundation study found that those who use
                              social media for two hours or more a day were more likely to experience loneliness, and that
                              over half of the participants perceive reliance on technology as a major problem.
                              But what leads people to this increasingly isolated place? This trend was on the rise before
                              social media and personal technology were widely adopted. What is it about the real physical
                              world that we live in that drives us towards a solitary and virtual life lacking meaningful social
                              ties? According to an analysis by Robert D. Putnam, political scientist and author of Bowling
                              Alone, the rise of social isolation can be traced alongside the rapid suburbanization of the
                              United States over the last half century (2014). During the first half of the century, nearly 80% of
                              Americans lived in either tight-knit, high-density city neighborhoods designed for walkability with
                              rich sidewalk life or in small rural towns anchored by similarly compact main streets designed for
                              shopping and congregating. But by the mid 1990’s over half of the country lived in newly
                              constructed suburbs, sprawling outwards from a city, forming a large metropolitan patchwork of
                              bedroom communities, disparate shopping centers, and office parks (Putnam, 2014).
                              This was fueled in large part by the postwar demand for home ownership as a result of the GI
                              bill, which led to aggressive tax incentives that promoted excessive building. Increasingly
                              educated rural Americans moved to these new developments to be closer to the center of white
                              collar work: cities. Simultaneously, many white urban residents fled to the suburbs to escape
                              diversifying neighborhoods. Low density, stand alone homes became one of the prevailing
                              ideals of the “American Dream” further fueling this migratory pattern. Initially suburban residents
                              continued to travel into the city for work. But soon office parks sprung up on the outskirts of
                              towns dedicated expressly to operating business, forming their own little edge cities without any
                              of the social amenities (Donnelly, 2008). Rural communities experienced the starkest decline
                              over time, losing over half of their population by the early 2000’s (Donnelly, 2008). These shifts
                              took a toll on the associated economies and infrastructure of city centers and rural towns as
                              businesses shuttered and a lack of investment took hold, eroding what were once the centers of
                              social life.
                            </p>

                              It is important to note that in the 1960’s and 70’s, suburbs were predominately white, and middle
                              class. Since the 1980’s, the cultural and socioeconomic makeup of the suburbs has expanded,
                              representing high and low income brackets as well as numerous different cultures, though they
                              still tend to be segregated by these factors (Florida, 2019). Rising rents in cities over the last
                              two decades has contributed to this trend, as people are priced out of gentrified neighborhoods
                              closer to the city and into more affordable exurban communities. The Covid-19 pandemic
                              pushed even more people outward, as a desire for more space took root.
                              The majority of the country now works, shops and socializes in areas that are geographically
                              dislocated, and importantly, privately owned. Zoning laws largely prohibit retail and restaurants
                              from residential areas, which are now relegated to shopping centers and malls separated from
                              neighborhoods by freeways, and centered around parking lots. Architects of the earliest malls
                              imagined that they would replace the social function of main streets. But they aren’t anchored by
                              any one particular social network because Americans often travel by car from several
                              surrounding communities to visit them. And over time, because these spaces are privately
                              owned by developers and exist specifically for financial gain, they are increasingly designed to
                              keep people spending, not socializing (Hanchett, 1996). These individuating priorities mean
                              increasingly fewer spaces devoted to social gathering.
                            </p>

                              Underpinning all of this is the necessity of driving. Putnam writes that “American adults average
                              seventy-two minutes every day behind the wheel, according to the Department of
                              Transportation’s Personal Transportation Survey” with more than half of our car trips being
                              made alone. He found that for every additional ten minutes in daily commute correlates with a
                              10% decrease in involvement in social interactions (p. 212-213, 2014). Commuting to work
                              accounts for a large share of this time, as Americans travel further to and from work. And similar
                              to the effect seen in malls, many people are driving to work from disparate communities, which
                              could lead to weaker social ties within the workplace. Indeed, a study by Cigna found that one in
                              two workers experiences workplace loneliness (Loneliness and the Workplace, 2020). If we look
                              at all of this cumulatively, the prevailing design of our communities and the ways in which we are
                              required to interact with them are booby-trapped with socially isolating experiences.
                              With the increased attention on loneliness as a public health crisis, some policy makers, urban
                              planners and architects are looking to combat this through more human-centric redevelopment
                              projects. Having witnessed the stark rise in loneliness, anxiety and depression among their
                              students, UC San Diego hired HKS Architects to design a new affordable residence hall with an
                              emphasis on facilitating social interactions and better learning outcomes. The resulting North
                              Torrey Pines Living and Learning Center is a dense, mixed-use facility that functions more like a
                              neighborhood main street than a dorm. It’s connected to the surrounding community by multiple
                              methods of public transit and walking and bike paths. And rather than offering individual dorm
                              rooms, students live in communal apartments that are clustered around shared spaces like
                              lounges and multi-level outdoor spaces. On the ground floor is a mix of restaurants, markets,
                              retail, social services like a post office, and open green space, all easily accessible by foot.
                              Lecture halls and craft centers are integrated within the building. And they’ve also included a
                              community rooftop garden that students can help maintain, which in turn provides produce for
                              the communal kitchen and dining hall where students can take cooking classes. The intention is
                              that students must move through several layers of communal social spaces before reaching
                              their rooms, reinforcing frequent social encounters which reduce the likelihood of isolation.

                              To measure the impact of the design, the architects partnered with the University and the Center
                              for Advanced Design Research and Evaluation to create a Research Coalition with two research
                              fellows who live in the neighborhood and conduct behavior mapping, focus group conversations
                              and data gathering. Results from the first year were marked by a 8.2% reduction in feelings of
                              loneliness and depression among residents. Satisfaction with living spaces rose over 30% and
                              access to social spaces over 20% (HKS, 2020). This research was conducted in 2020 at the
                              height of the pandemic, during which time social interactions were scarce and fraught. Upon a
                              return to a greater sense of social normalcy, it’s reasonable to assume a greater increase in
                              these perceived benefits.

                              Similarly, The Kampung Admiralty, a senior residential community in Singapore was designed
                              with the intention of combating loneliness among their large aging population and fostering
                              intergenerational socializing. The Singaporean government worked in partnership with WOHA
                              Architects to design a village within a building that provides a diverse community of elderly
                              people easy to access amenities and opportunities to interact with the outside world. Using what
                              they described as the “club sandwich” approach, the resulting space is a multilevel community
                              with layers of studio apartments, gardens, medical facilities, and social spaces. On the ground
                              floor is a hawker fare, restaurants, and retail, blurring the lines between private and public space
                              and encouraging integration of the surrounding community.

                              The gardens are open to the public and are terraced, occupying almost every level. There is
                              also a community farm that residents tend to, and buddy benches at shared entrances to
                              apartments that encourage residents to mingle with their neighbors. WOHA uses an index
                              called The Green Plot Ratio, which measures the amount of landscaped surfaces compared to a
                              development’s site area. The ratio at Kampung Admiralty is 110%. This is especially important
                              as a 2021 International Journal of Epidemiology study found that neighborhoods with larger
                              shares, 30% or more, of public greenspace have been shown to reduce loneliness among
                              residents by 52% among adults who live alone (Astell-Burt et al., 2021).
                              One of the main intentions of the design was to entice the outside world in, creating
                              opportunities for intergenerational interaction. They included a childcare center that eldery
                              residents’ grandchildren and others from the surrounding community can attend. The
                              programming for the center includes storytelling from elderly residents, giving them an
                              opportunity to interact with the children and other residents. Similarly, the “people’s plaza” on the
                              ground level is both fully public and easily accessible for the residents within which the
                              community can participate in organized events, shop, or eat at the hawker center on the second
                              story. In a 2020 poll, residents reported an 8% increase in feeling meaningful and satisfied in
                              life.

                              Both North Torrey Pines and Kampung Admiralty are high density environments. It could be
                              challenging to take the same approach on a large scale in our communities given the United
                              State’s long standing attachment to more spacious and private living quarters. But many of the
                              features can be adapted with this in mind and adopted to a similar effect. By changing zoning
                              laws, communities could transition from solely residential to more mixed-use. Urban planners

                              and architects could integrate iterative mini villages within the fabric of our residential
                              neighborhoods, reappropriating houses or redeveloping empty lots or corner gas stations for
                              small-scale local business like restaurants and social services, as well as communal green
                              space with seating, gardens and play equipment.

                              A good illustration of this kind of adaptive model would be the Oglethorpe plan that Savannah,
                              GA is built upon. “The plan uses a distinctive street network with repeating squares of
                              residential blocks, commercial blocks, and small green parks to create integrated, walkable
                              neighborhoods. At the heart of Oglethorpe's comprehensive and multi-faceted plan there was a
                              vision of social equity and civic virtue” (Oglethorpe Plan, n.d.). The city is composed of wards,
                              each containing eight city blocks around a square (four residential blocks in the corners, each
                              split by a narrow lane, plus four smaller commercial blocks east and west of the square).
                              This would allow for the integration of small, but many, higher density housing options built into
                              or above the commercial corridors, without casting a large shadow, both literally and figuratively,
                              over a more low slung residential block. By focusing on repeatable patterns of small-scale
                              redevelopment projects, architects and development agencies could avoid lengthy periods of
                              construction which are disruptive to human life. The scale also makes it friendlier to smaller local
                              businesses, which give back both in investment and in fostering a shared sense of local identity,
                              as well as providing employment opportunities that are closer to home.

                              The prevailing organizing principle of our society for the last half century has been to prioritize
                              private space and design for economic gain over social connection. The lack of localized,
                              walkable social amenities, and public space like town squares that foster gathering, and the
                              increased necessity of commuting are leading Americans to an increasingly solitary existence,
                              with a large share of the population spending their time bouncing from one lonely space to
                              another. By shifting our approach to design to create more porous, layered and easily
                              accessible (walkable) corridors between private spaces and increasing the share of public
                              domains and green space, we can build in greater opportunity for social connection, loosening
                              the grip of loneliness in our communities.
